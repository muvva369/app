It has already been an year.....
since you overwhelmed me with your glorious presence
after all who would have thought 
that love would slam into my heart that had only known parents and all silly things...
that a man like me whose mission was to take responsibilities and purpose would find comfort in his WOMAN's embrace...
that ONE petite woman can hold the disparate beads of my life together like the thread in a crystal-bead necklace....

We may have struggles and bumps along the way but what is important now is 
I have you by my side to face anything that may come our way. 
Together we are stronger, together we will accomplish anything, together we are one.

I wish we celebrate many more anniversaries like these...Happy Anniversary my dear WIFE...
